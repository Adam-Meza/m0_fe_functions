# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

I feel like I've been pretty good at time management as far as completing assignments go. My tip would be reading ahead. It takes me about three read throughs to get a concept so I get the first two of them out of the way before class. That way once the assignment is actually due it takes me less time to actually do it. 

Something I think I need to work on is letting myself relax. I get anxious when I don't feel ahead of things so I'll catch up with everything and even be ahead but it can be hard to step away and feel like i've done enough

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

programming is telling computers do to stuff. you can type about a long string of stuff for a computer to do, like a big list of instructions. and you can attach it to a function. so instead of having to type all that stuff out next time you wanna do it 
, you can use the function and it does the same thing

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
parameters are a type of variable found inside of functions. they serve as place holders for arguements, which are actual data that is input later when the funciton is called. 
 
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?

could a function be an arguement?
